# react-firebase-template
This is a React app template, with [Firebase SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/client/libraries) for backend services (i.e. cloud functions, etc), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for Styling, [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) for building, [React Router Dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) for routing, [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing and finally [Firebase's hosting service](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting) for deployment.

## Here are some things you need in your device before proceeding:
- Latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- Latest version of [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (optional) 

## How to use/setup this template in your local device
1. Clone this repository into your local device
2. Navigate to the repository folder (e.g. react-firebase-template)
3. Run `npm install`
4. Create a new firebase project on [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
5. Then click the project settings on the project overview on the left navigation bar
6. Then at the "your apps" section create a web app 
7. Name your web app and fill in other details 
> **ðŸ’¡ NOTE**  
Don't enable firebase hosting option while creating the app, which could break this template
1. Copy your app's configuration
2. Open [`firebase.js`](./src/firebase.js) and paste the configuration in the commented area like:
```javascript
const app = initializeApp({
    apiKey: "...",
    authDomain: "...",
    projectId: "...",
    storageBucket: "...",
    messagingSenderId: "...",
    appId: "..."
})
```
1.  Run that file using `node src/firebase.js` and after that you can ignore that file
2.  Install firebase CLI tool by `npm install -g firebase-tools`
3.  Login to firebase using firebase CLI tool in your environment by `firebase login`
4.  Be sure to build the app before proceeding to the next step by using `npm run build`
5.  Then run `firebase init` to create the project
    - There will be many questions to answer to create the project and you pretty solve most of them by your own but here are some main ones to know:
        - For selecting firebase services be sure to enable the first hosting option for hosting on firebase while also the second hosting option to deploy the app on every push or pull request merged to the main branch 
            > **ðŸ’¡ NOTE**  
            By enabling the second hosting option for Github actions will ask more questions related to your github repositories, etc but you can answer them if you have decent knowledge about Github
        - For the build directory enter `dist` instead of `public` which is already given because since we use [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) the build directory will be automatically `dist` 
        - For overwriting the index.html in `dist` directory enter `n` (*if you already ran `npm run build` and if not cancel this process and run `npm run build` and then try again*)     
6.  After this you are only one step to deploy the application! Just run `firebase deploy` or `firebase deploy --only hosting` (*if you are in spark plan in firebase*)

    **Congratulations! You managed to successfully deploy the application globally!**

## How to setup a React app on your own like this without using this template

### Create the application
1. Create a React app using [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) by running this command `npm create vite@latest <your-project-name> -- --template react`
2. Navigate into the project/app directory 
3. Run `npm install` 

### Integrate Tailwind CSS
1. Install the required dependencies using `npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer` 
2. Create the config files by running `npx tailwindcss init -p`
3. Open the [`tailwind.config.js`](tailwind.config.js) and replace the entire content on the file with this:
```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.js",
    "./src/**/*.jsx",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```
4. You can delete all the CSS files in the project/app and create a global css file for the project/name which any name you want
    > **ðŸ’¡ NOTE**  
    You can create a separate directory (e.g. [`/src/css`](./src/css/)) and create the global css file inside it just like this template or you can just create the global css file within the [`./src`](./src/) directory itself
5. In that global css file paste this content on the top of the file:
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
6. Then import the global css file in your [`App.jsx/js`](./src/App.jsx) file or any other file which is relative to it.

    **Now you can easily use tailwind css across the project/app and you don't need to import the global css file every time on every component/file!**

### Add React Router DOM for routing
1. Install the required dependency using `npm install react-router-dom`
    > **ðŸ’¡ NOTE**  
    Remember the way we setup and use react router dom might be different from any other ordinary methods to use react router dom. You can still use any other method but we use our own method to use react router dom.
2. Create your pages in a separate directory on [`./src`](./src/) directory (e.g. [`./src/pages`](./src/pages/)) or you can just store them wherever you want inside the [`./src`](./src/) directory. 
    > **ðŸ’¡ NOTE**  
    You can create those pages just like any other jsx component. For example:
```javascript
export default function Home() {
    return (
        <div>Home</div>
    )
}
 ```
3. Open the [`App.jsx/js`](./src/App.jsx) file or any other file relevant to that
4. Import `useRoutes` from `react-router-dom`
5. Paste this snippet inside the file's main function:
```javascript
let routes = useRoutes([
    {
        path: '/',
        children: [
            {
                index: true,
                element: <Home />
            },
            {
                path: '/page2',
                element: <Page2 />
            },
            {
                path: '/page3',
                element: <Page3 />
            }
        ]
    }
])
```
6. And return the `routes` in the main function and finally the main function should look like this:
```javascript
function App() {
    let routes = useRoutes([
        {
            path: '/',
            children: [
                {
                    index: true,
                    element: <Home />
                },
                {
                    path: '/page2',
                    element: <Page2 />
                },
                {
                    path: '/page3',
                    element: <Page3 />
                }
            ]
        }
    ])

    return (
        <>
            <div className='w-full min-h-screen'>
                {routes}
            </div>
        </>
    )
}
```

**Awesome! You successfully setup React Router DOM!
